Task: 
Test
Create a React app (using create-react-app) with
TypeScript. Use MobX for state management,
for styles - SCSS.
Appendix: form with two fields - first and last name +
the button “Done”, which will show the modal
ono (not alert (), but self-styled) with the caption
"Hello, NAME SURNAME" (substitute written in
form) and the button to close the modal. If some field in
the form is not filled in - then the modal should not be shown, but displayed
I will make a mistake with an empty field.
The application should fit in one screen and look like
ok on a desktop, and on a mobile.
It is important not to use ready-made libraries of styles / shapes / modals.
Pour the result to the repository on github (under your account)
